# U.S.-Capitals-Game
A game through python (utilizing turtle and pandas) where you guess the capitals and if you get it right, it will be written on the map. Try to get all 50! By pulling data from a csv and manipulating it with the pandas library as well as using the turtle library for the text input, I combined the two to create an interactive gaming experience. I used turtle to get the mouse click coordinates of where to write each capital (I left the code in there but commented it out), but it was not perfect so I did the extremely tedious work of guessing every capital and fixing each coordinate individually, sometimes multiple times for each. But I am extremely happy with how it turned out! Also, another notable feature is when you are done, by either clicking cancel or typing exit, it will automatically make 2 new .csv files in the folder, one for capitals you didn't guess (to study) and another for capitals you are awesome at(you guessed them). Or you can finish the game and guess every single one! 
Also, since the textbox automatically pops up in the middle after you guess, I imported the time module to delay the screen after the newly guessed capital is written on the map to give a moment of just the screen to give the user time to look and think. Feel free to comment this out or additionally make the pause longer by putting a larger time.
